How to Use This Template
========================

To use this template you must first decide whether your GLEP is going to be an
Informational or Standards Track GLEP.  Most GLEPs are Standards Track because
they propose new functionality for some aspect of Gentoo Linux.  When in
doubt, read GLEP 1 for details or contact the GLEP editors <glep@gentoo.org>.

Once you've decided which type of GLEP yours is going to be, follow the
directions below.

- Change the Title header to the title of your GLEP.

- Change the Author header to include your name, and optionally your e-mail
  address.  Be sure to follow the format carefully: your name must appear
  first, and it must not be contained in parentheses.  Your e-mail address
  may appear second (or it can be omitted) and if it appears, it must appear
  in angle brackets.

- For Standards Track GLEPs, change the Type header to \"Standards Track\".

- For Informational GLEPs, change the Type header to \"Informational\".

- Change the Status header to \"Draft\".

- Reset the Version to \"1\".

- Change the Created and Last-Modified headers to today's date.  Be sure to
  follow the format carefully: it must be in ISO 8601 ``yyyy-mm-dd`` format.

- Reset the Post-History to empty for now; you'll add dates to this header
  each time you post your GLEP to gentoo-dev@lists.gentoo.org.  If you
  posted your GLEP to the list on August 14, 2003 and September 3, 2003,
  the Post-History header would look like::

      Post-History: 2003-08-14, 2003-09-03

  You must manually add new dates and check them in.  If you don't have
  check-in privileges, send your changes to the GLEP editors.

- For Standards Track GLEPs, if your feature depends on the acceptance
  of some other currently in-development GLEP, add a Requires header right
  after the Type header.  The value should be the GLEP number of the GLEP
  yours depends on.  Don't add this header if your dependent feature is
  described in a Final GLEP.

- Add a Replaces header if your GLEP obsoletes one or more earlier GLEPs.
  The value of this header is the numbers of the GLEPs that your new GLEP
  is replacing, separated by commas.  Only add this header if the older
  GLEP is in \"final\" form, i.e. is either Accepted, Final, or Rejected.
  You aren't replacing an older open GLEP if you're submitting a competing
  idea.

- Now write your Abstract, Rationale, and other content for your GLEP,
  replacing all of this gobbledygook with your own text.  Be sure to adhere
  to the format guidelines of GLEP 2 [#GLEP2]_, specifically on the
  indentation requirements.

- Update your References section.  Just leave the Copyright section alone,
  because all new GLEPs must be released under the Creative Commons
  Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC-BY-SA-4.0).

- Send your GLEP submission to the GLEP editors at glep@gentoo.org.


Abstract
========

A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

This is a sample template for creating your own reStructuredText GLEPs.
In conjunction with the content guidelines in GLEP 1 [#GLEP1]_, this should
make it easy for you to conform your own GLEPs to the format outlined below.


Motivation
==========

Provide adequate motivation here.  In this particular case, we need to provide
people with the information necessary to submit GLEPs in the proper form.


Specification
=============

The technical specification should describe the specific areas of Gentoo Linux
that would be touched by this GLEP.  If new functionality is being introduced,
what packages will that functionality affect?  If new policy, who will be
affected?


Rationale
=========

The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated
the design and why particular design decisions were made.  It should describe
alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature
is supported in other distributions.

The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and
discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.


Backwards Compatibility
=======================

Not a problem for this GLEP.  This section should be included *even* when it
is only to state that there are no backwards compatibility issues.


Reference Implementation
========================

The reference implementation must be completed before any GLEP is given
status \"Final\", but it need not be completed before the GLEP is accepted.
It is better to finish the specification and rationale first and reach
consensus on it before writing code or significantly modifying ebuilds.
